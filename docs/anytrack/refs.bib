ABSTRACT = {Calibrating intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters is a fundamental problem that is a preliminary task for a wide variety of applications, from robotics to computer vision to surveillance and industrial tasks. With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and edge computing capabilities, the ability to track motion activities in large outdoor areas has become feasible. The proposed work presents a network of IoT camera nodes and a dissertation on two possible approaches for automatically estimating their poses. One approach follows the Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline, while the other is marker-based. Both methods exploit the correspondence of features detected by cameras on synchronized frames. A preliminary indoor experiment was conducted to assess the performance of the two methods compared to ground truth measurements, employing a commercial tracking system of millimetric precision. Outdoor experiments directly compared the two approaches on a larger setup. The results show that the proposed SfM pipeline more accurately estimates the pose of the cameras. In addition, in the indoor setup, the same methods were used for a tracking application to show a practical use case.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the important image processing technologies is visual odometry (VO) technology. VO estimates platform motion through a sequence of images. VO is of interest in the virtual reality (VR) industry as well as the automobile industry because the construction cost is low. In this study, we developed stereo visual odometry (SVO) based on photogrammetric geometric interpretation. The proposed method performed feature optimization and pose estimation through photogrammetric bundle adjustment. After corresponding the point extraction step, the feature optimization was carried out with photogrammetry-based and vision-based optimization. Then, absolute orientation was performed for pose estimation through bundle adjustment. We used ten sequences provided by the Karlsruhe institute of technology and Toyota technological institute (KITTI) community. Through a two-step optimization process, we confirmed that the outliers, which were not removed by conventional outlier filters, were removed. We also were able to confirm the applicability of photogrammetric techniques to stereo visual odometry technology.},
